Accurate predictions of Fantasy Football scores can make a difference in a Fantasy Football league. 
The provided files were used to create a dataset and evaluate Machine Learning techniques, 
namely Support Vector Regression and Neural Networks, on 2014 NFL game data.

To get the NFL data, I used the nflgame package from github which is downloadable with the following commands:

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install nflgame
sudo nflgame-update-players
